# Research-Papers-Recommendation-System-and-Subject-Area-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning-and-LLMS

# Project Summary

This repository contains a machine learning project designed to serve two main purposes: recommending research papers and predicting their subject areas. The system aims to deliver personalized paper recommendations according to user interests and accurately classify research papers into their respective fields.

# Key Components

# Research Paper Recommendation

The system employs sentence transformers to generate sentence embeddings and applies cosine similarity measures to recommend papers that align closely with user preferences and similar document vectors.

# Deep Learning Model

An MLP-based deep learning architecture is utilized to identify complex relationships within the data, enabling precise prediction of a paper's subject area.

# Subject Area Classification

The project leverages NLP methods to categorize research papers by analyzing their text content and assigning them to appropriate subject categories.

# Usage Instructions

* Prepare a dataset containing paper titles, abstracts, and their labeled subject areas.
* Use the provided notebook to train models aimed at predicting the subject classifications.

# Outcomes

* The recommendation system suggests the top K relevant papers based on similarity metrics.
* The deep learning model enhances recommendation accuracy, achieving a 99% success rate.
* Subject area predictions classify papers effectively with strong performance.
